<h1>Brief</h1>

<p> A database is an organized collection of structured data that is typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
    Data within the most common form of databases today is typically done in rows and columns with a series of 
	tables to make processing and data querying efficient. This also allows for data can then be easily accessed, managed,
	modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.
    In this internal we have created a database about books we have included information such as the authors name, book genre etc.
	This database has been created with the intention of organising a book club through the data base we can record different books 
	and their associated information. We will also be able to record who in the book club has read what boook whitch will helpful so 
    that nobody has to read the same book twice. If someone was to read a book but for example forgot the author and its title then 
    as all books in the book club are stored on the data base they would be able to find the book by using querys such as selecting 
	only books with a specific genre.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1> Relevant Implications - Description </h1> 
<p> Functionality </p>
<p> For the relevant implication of functionality to be met there must be no errors and no incorrectly entered data in the database. The database
	should work as expected meaning the user can get any information in any combination. </p>
<p> Future Proofing </p>
<p> The future proofing implication can be met if databases are designed in a way that allows for them to be updated and have features added to it.
	The database should also still function as expected if data is added or removed. </p>
<p> Usability </p>
<p> The implication of usability is a measure of how well a user can use a product to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.
	To ensure usability in a database information is displayed in a comprehensible way. </p>

<h1> Version One </h1>

<p> In this version I have created a spreadsheet were everything is stored together so that I can preempt problems that might occur later and
	try to prevent them. </p>

<p> Plan with data types and restrictions on data input </p>
<img src="Images/v1_table.jpg">

<p> Reflection </p> 
<p> Blank spaces for series as not all books are part of a series Multiple categories in the same cell eg. The genre of the book should be in a seperate catorgry 
	Simple design for the next database meaning some the the data may be left behind 
	There is lots of repetition particularly in Authors and genres We dropped the book 'Code' as it had two authors 
	For the next version we would like to made a books table + authors table and then connect them 
	There should not be any duplication of data in the database. Data should be stored in such a way 
	that it should not be repeated in multiple tables. If repeated, it would be an unnecessary waste of DB space, and maintaining such data becomes chaos.

<h1> Version Two </h1>

<p> In this version I have created a Book Name Table (version_2) and a Author Table (version_2.1). For the field names under the Book name table I included 
	BooksID which was the primary key, Title, Date, NumPages, ScreenPlay, SeriesName and AuthorID which is linked with the Author Table.
    Under the Book Name table was also had Genre and Publisher but I took them out as they may have caused problems later on. In the 
    Author Table the field names were ID which is joined to the Author ID in the Book Name table, FristName, last name, year of birth and origin. </p>

 <p> Reflection (+ anything about relevant implications) </p>
 <p> In this version I was able to create and join tables and craete a database which follows the relevant implications
	 to some extent though it could be improved upon by stream lining different aspects of the database such as 
	 creating tables allocated to similar field names.

<p> In this version we added the tables version_3.1 or GenreId, version_3.1_AssociationTable, version_3.2 or readerId and version_3.2_AssociationTable.

<p> Reflection (+ anything about relevant implications) </p>
<P> In this verison I have finalised my database. It follows the relevant Implications
	of functionality, future proofing and usability. It could be imporved further by creating 
    more tables therefore allowing to store more information for the user to access. </P>
<hr>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1> Relevant Implications - Summary </h1>

<p> Functionality</p>
<p>For the relevant implication of functionality to met there need to be no errors as well as no incorrectly entered data. The database 
should also work as expected meaning the user can get any information in any combination. We met this implication as a varaiaty of are 
able to be run in our books database.
</p>

<p> Future Proofing </p>
<p> Our database is future proofed as it can be updated and have features added to it, data can be removed or added. And we are also able to 
	plug in new tables without having to reconstruct the entire databse.
	</p>

<p> Usability </p>
<p> The database follows the implication of usability because the information is displayed in a comprehensible way and the feild names are easily
	 understood and organsied in a senitable way.
